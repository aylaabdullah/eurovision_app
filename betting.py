        Each year, as the Eurovision Song Contest draws near, fans across Europe - and beyond - start placing their bets. 
        Eurovision has become more than just a musical competition;
        it's a spectacle of culture, performance and passionate predictions. Betting companies have capitalized on this excitement, offering odds on potential winners, finalists,
        and even who might come in last. We have betting organisations' data for the years 2016 - 2023. 
        While some companies consistently cover the event, others dip in and out, and not all ofer bets on every country or every year.

        In this section, we’ll take a closer look at how the betting landscape has evolved over the years. 
        Specifically, we’ll explore:</p>
            1) Which countries placed in the top 3 each year?</p>
            2) How did various betting companies position their odds for those years?</p>
            3) How closely did those predictions align with the actual results?</p>
        Let’s explore whether the bookies saw it coming—or if Eurovision did what it does best: deliver the unexpected.</p>

        To dive deeper, we've used <strong>power regression models</strong> to analyze the relationship between betting odds and final placements—helping us understand 
        just how predictive (or not) the odds really were. <strong>Power Regression</strong> is a type of nonlinear regression used when the relationship between two variables
        follows: <strong>y = a.x^b</strong> </p>
        This model is useful when the effect of x on y increases or decreases non-linearly i.e., <strong>how strongly betting odds predict outcomes but in a non-linear way.</strong></p>
        Maybe a small improvement in odds (e.g., going from 4:1 to 2:1) massively increases the chances of winning - and this wouldn't be captured well in a linear model.
